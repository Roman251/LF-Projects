## Time Series Analysis of air quality of the city Delhi.
Based on the analysis, a couple of hypothesis were set, and they were tested accordingly. 

```
Hypothesis : The data shows both seasonality and trend
The chart showed that, while the data had seasonality, it did not have a trend.

This assumption was made because India enforced a nationwide lockdown from 25-03-2020 to 31-05-2020

```
Finding : In the month of November, pollution tends to spike up. The PM2.5 counter reads above 400!!

This spike is sometimes attributed to farmers from Punjab and Haryana who set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting paddy and before cultivating wheat and potato.
